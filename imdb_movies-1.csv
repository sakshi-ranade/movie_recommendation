To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.","['dystopia', 'giant robot', 'giant monster', 'apocalypse', 'imax', 'duringcreditsstinger', '3d']","To Fight Monsters, We Created Monsters",Released,['English'],"['Legendary Pictures', 'Warner Bros.', 'Disney Double Dare You (DDY)', 'Indochina Productions']","['United States of America', 'Canada']",180000000,407602906
